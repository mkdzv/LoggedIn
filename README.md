# LoggedIn
LoggedIn is a log analysis system designed to process Windows Event Logs and identify suspicious login attempts. This tool includes automated reporting features to reduce manual log review time for security teams. I built the tool with Python and integrated it with Splunk, I also added NumPy for analysis and Matplotlib for data visualization.

## Features
- **Automated Logs**: Automated parsing of Windows Security Event Logs (Event ID 4624, 4625, etc.)
- **Splunk Integration**: Splunk integration for log management
- **Numpy Analysis**: Statistical analysis using NumPy
- **Matplotlib Visualization**: Data visualization with Matplotlib
- **Attack Detection**: Detection of brute force attacks and suspicious login attempts
- **Timely Detection**: Time-based detection (off-hours login activity)
- **Data Analysis**: Failed login attempt analysis
